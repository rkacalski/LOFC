  skillDescript: "A large chance to increase this unit\u2019s EVA by 200.0% during
    battle. If this unit then dodges an attack, it will immediately counter attack
    for that turn. However, an S-Range unit can only attack an adjacent enemy."
  Descript: As the cyborg leader of the Droid Army, General Grievous is a superior
    commander. His skills at wielding up to four Lightsabers at once make him a deadly
    opponent. Many Jedi have fallen victim to his ruthless attacks. Whether they
    be Masters, or merely Padawans, no Jedi is safe.
